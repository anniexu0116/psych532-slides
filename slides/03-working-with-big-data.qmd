# Best practices in naming things (files in particular)

- Machine readable
- Human readable
- Plays well with default ordering


::: {tiny}
Based on Jenny Bryan's work
:::

# Machine readable

- Usable with regular expressions and globbing
  - No spaces
  - No punctuation
  - No accented characters (or other funky stuff)
  - Case matters

- Easy to use in code
  - Use the delimiters deliberately

# Some things you could do

![](images/horst-cases1.png)


# And a few you probably shouldn't

![](images/horst-cases2.png)


# An extreme example


The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)

A standard for storing and describing neuroimaging data

# The anatomy of a BIDS filename

`key1-value_key2-value_suffix.extension`

- Entities are composed of key-value pairs
- Suffix provides some additional information (the data type: fMRI, anatomical, etc.)
- For example:
  - `sub-control1`, `task-nback` are entities
  - `T1w` and `bold` are suffixes
  - `.nii.gz` and `.tsv` are extensions


# This allows querying on a large list of files with code

```

```

# Human readable

- Files that are related to each other can be visually grouped

# Consider putting numeric values first

# Use ISO 8601 compliant dates

- An international standard for communicating about date/time
- For filenames, usually time is not relevant, but dates may be
- I recommend the `YYYYMMDD` format (but also sometimes use `YYYY-MM-DD`)

# Sometimes names are related to standards

- We saw BIDS before
- Different programming languages also have standards about naming variables
  - For example, PEP8 for Python, [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R.
